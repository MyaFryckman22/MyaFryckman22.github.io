			<p class="explanation">Black bears are very cool and awesome. This is undoubtly a fact, now we shall go to some information I got from Wikipedia. "The American black bear (Ursus americanus), or simply black bear, is a medium-sized bear endemic to North America. It is the continent's smallest and most widely distributed bear species. American black bears are omnivores, with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location. They typically live in largely forested areas, but will leave forests in search of food, and are sometimes attracted to human communities due to the immediate availability of food. Despite the name, some subspecies can be brown or even blond in coloration. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the American black bear as a least-concern species, due to its widespread distribution and a large population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined. Along with the brown bear (Ursus arctos), it is one of only two modern bear species not considered by the IUCN to be globally threatened with extinction." </p>

			<p class="explaintwo"> I still don't know what exactly to write but I have a ton of passion for blackbears. There is a blackbear sancutary up by my cabin and I try to head out there as often as possible, it's a nice area where you can see blackbears roaming at a popular feeding ground. I took my little cousin there last summer and she absolutely addored it, I am beyond excited to go there again this year. It's always been a very cool experience and the bears really don't pay much attention to visitors and just sort of chill and vibe with each other. It was a really cool experience just seeing bears in the wild, just to be clear I visit this viewing deck that overlooks a small field where the back bears hang out. They are out of reach of humans and don't really have a chance to interact with them. Check out Vince Shute Wildlife Sanctuary. </p>
