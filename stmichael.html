		<p class="edit">[edit]</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>A post office called St. Michael has been in operation since 1858.[9] The city took its name from St. Michael Roman Catholic Church.[10] St. Michael was incorporated in 1890.[10] The Corner Bar, a restaurant in service since 1897, was on 10 Main Street South downtown which shut down January 9, 2020 and was razed on Friday, August 14, 2020. Generational patrons drove by and many stopped to collect a brick or two to commemorate the end of this era. Oddly enough the founding father of Ditto's Bar, down the street from the Corner Bar, also left this earth days later while the name and establishment still live on in Main Street.[11] A complete history of the city, ‘’Faith, Family and Farming’’, was written by Bob Zahler.[12] The history is also tracked by the St. Michael Historical Society, whose mission is "to collect, preserve and share the history of the City of St. Michael."[13]</p>

There is also a private Catholic school in St. Michael for grades K–8, including preschool.</p>
		<p>A new high school opened for the 2009–10 school year, and a dedication ceremony took place on September 20, 2009. The previous high school was converted into a new middle school (Middle School West). The current middle school has been renamed Middle School East.[citation needed]</p>
