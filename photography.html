	<p>These are photo's I had taken of my three beloved pets</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Gunner: dog, yorkshire terrier, 10?, grumpy old man</li>
		<li>Brinley: dog, German Shorthaired Pointer, 5, energetic ball of chaos</li>
		<li>Sophie: cat, tortise shell, 11, hasn't seemed to age since we adopted her at 1</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="disclosure">**I don't want anything that reveals too much as to who I am ,which is most of my pictures, on the internet for everyone to see so I figured pets should be good**</p>
